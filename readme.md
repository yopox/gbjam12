All minions have an ATK and HP stats.
They can also have an effect that triggers during the fight.

- **Pumpkins**: Pumpkins boost other towers. Pumpkins shoot only after receiving damage.
- **Spiders**: Spiders have effects related to permanent boosts.
- **Ghosts**: Ghosts can become <strong>ghostly, in this state the next shot received will not inflict any damage.
- **Skeletons**: Skeletons have effects related to attack bonuses and shooting more often.

Fights are automatic! Columns activates one after each other, from left to right.
All boosts that aren't permanent will be removed after the fight.

The fight ends when no column can shoot anymore (pumpkins and minions with 0 ATK can't shoot), or when one team does not have any HP left.
